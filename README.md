  <b>What is C?</b>
  C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
  It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a
  fundamental language in the field of computer science. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was 
  developed to write the UNIX operating system.

  <b>Why Learn C?</b>
  It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
  If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, 
  C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java 
  and Python. C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies

  <b>Difference between C and C++</b>
